Walter has a doctor's appointment and has to leave Jesse in charge of preparing their next cook. He left Jesse a list of solutions, amounts, and the appropriate scientific instrument to use for each step in the correct order on their laptop. However, Jesse doesn't understand Javascript format, and needs help!

Use a function helpJesse() that uses a LOOP to read through the array and logs a comprehensible list of steps, formatted exactly like this:

1. Pour 5 mL of Sodium Chloride into a Graduated Cylinder
2. Pour 250 mL of Hydrochloric Acid into a Boiling Flask
3. Pour 100 mL of Water into a Erlenmeyer Flask
4. Pour 2 mL of Liquid Mercury into a Pipette
5. Pour 500 mL of Sulfate into a Volumetric Flask
6. Pour 30 mL of Phosphoric Acid into a Beaker
