In this program, your goal is to find the factorial of a number.

You will have to write a function factorial() that takes an integer "x" and calculates the factorial.
For example, inputting 5 should calculate 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

To test, here are some expected input/outputs:

I: factorial(5);
O: 120

I: factorial(8);
O: 40320
