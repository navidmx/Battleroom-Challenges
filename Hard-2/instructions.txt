All of Raj's once loner friends are now happily in a relationship. Even Sheldon. However, instead of getting his own girlfriend, he wants things to go back to the way they were - just four SINGLE guys and NO girls.

An array of objects "squad" is given in Hard-2.js - You need to use a LOOP to go through all the items in the object and:

1) Get rid of the three girls (Penny, Bernadette, Amy)

2) Make the status of all the remaining guys "Single"

Use a function manCave() that returns the variable squad the output should look like this:

[ { name: 'Leonard', status: 'Single' },
  { name: 'Howard', status: 'Single' },
  { name: 'Sheldon', status: 'Single' },
  { name: 'Raj', status: 'Single' } ]
