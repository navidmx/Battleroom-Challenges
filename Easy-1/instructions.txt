In this program, your goal is to take the lengths of two sides of a right triangle, and find the length of the missing side.

This will require TWO functions:

hypotenuse(a, b), which finds the hypotenuse "c" of the right triangle, given the two legs "a" and "b"

OR

leg(a, c), which finds the missing leg "b" of a right triangle, given leg "a", and the hypotenuse "c".

To test, here are some expected input/outputs:

I: hypotenuse(3,4);
O: c = 5

I: leg(3,5);
O: b = 4
