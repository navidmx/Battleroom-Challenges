In this program, your goal is to take a SENTENCE, reverse the letters in each word, BUT keep the order of the words the same.

You will have to write a function reverseSentence() that takes a string "str".
Keep in mind, this is for a full sentence.

To test, here are some expected input/outputs:

I: reverseSentence("Hello World!");
O: olleH !dlorW

I: reverseSentence("123 + 321 = 444");
O: 321 + 123 = 444
