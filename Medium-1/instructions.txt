In this program, your goal is to take a WORD and reverse the letters in it.

You will have to write a function reverseWord() that takes a string "str" and reverses the order.
Keep in mind, this is for a SINGULAR WORD, not a sentence.

To test, here are some expected input/outputs:

I: reverseWord("Hello");
O: olleH

I: reverseWord("racecar");
O: racecar

(^ That one's neat, huh?)
